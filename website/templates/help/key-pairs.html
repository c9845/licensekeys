                                    <p>Public key cryptography is the underlying tool that allows for authenticating a license. A private key is used to create a signature of some data while a public key is used to verify the signature.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>The private key is stored only within the License Key Server and thus valid licenses can only be generated by the License Key Server. The public key is embedded within your app's code for verifying the license as needed.</p>

                                    <p>You can choose the type, and possibly bit size or curve, for each key pair you create based on your needs, compliance requirements, etc. Larger bit sizes and certain curves are stronger; RSA is the weakest key pair algorithm even with it's large bit size.</p>

                                    <h5>Private Key Encryption:</h5>
                                    <p>Each private key is encrypted at rest, by default, when it is stored in the License Key Server's database. This adds a layer of protection in case your database is stolen or leaked. The encryption key is stored in the License Key Server's configuration file; store this file securely!<p>

                                    </p><i class="text-danger">Warning!</i> You can disable, or change the encryption key, if needed. However, this will prevent any previously created key pairs for being used to sign new licenses.</p>
