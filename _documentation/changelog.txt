2.1.1
----------
- Notes:
    - Fix bug when an numeric value was provided in a text custom field. License could not be created.
- Update Process:
    - Backup database and app files (backup server, take snapshot, etc.).
    - Stop the app's executable.
    - Copy and overwrite existing app files.
    - Restart the app's executable.

2.1.0
----------
- Notes:
    - Improve config file validation and handling of paths.
    - Update go dependencies.
    - Add DatetimeModified column to key_value table to be similar to other tables.
    - Add Referrer column to activity_log table to capture more diagnostic info.
    - Fix bug with 2FA enrollment QR code not displaying.
    - Activity log and user login history now use "page plus API call" style to load page and data.
        - Page loads near instantly with a "loading" message for data, less obvious latency to the end user.
        - Better filtering options.
    - Make sure database query statments are closed after use (defer stmt.Close()) to prevent db resource exhaustion.
    - Use hashfs for serving of static assets, improved caching and cache busting.
    - Use fs.FS for handling all source GUI files (HTML templates, CSS, JS), easier handling between on-disk and embedded files.
    - Migrate everything from third-party templates package to internal pages package, one less dependency and easier to manage.
    - Fix some styling bugs.
    - Fix some UI interaction bugs.
    - Rename Verify() to VerifySignature() to be clearer in what this func does. This does not check if a license is expired.
        - Existing Verify() func is deprecated and just calls VerifySignature().
    - Better document how to Verify() and then check expiration with Expired().
        - Client example.
        - README.
    - Remove reverify functionality since it wasn't really used. End-users should just implement this as they see fit.
- New Features:
    - Add user profile page so users can change their own passwords, they no longer need to speak with an admin.
    - Define new functionality for checking if a license is expired.
        - Had a bit of this before, but it wasn't clean.
        - New Expired(), ExpiresIn(), and ExpiresInDays() funcs to help here.
- DB Schema Update:
    - New Columns:
        - key_value:
            - DatetimeModified DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
        - activity_log:
            - Referrer TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT ""
- Update Process:
    - Backup database and app files (backup server, take snapshot, etc.).
    - Stop the app's executable.
    - Copy and overwrite existing app files.
    - Run executable with --update-db flag. Wait for successful completion.
    - Restart the app's executable.
