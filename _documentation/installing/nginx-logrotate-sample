# This file handles the NGINX log files from running this app, specifically
# the acccess.log and error.log files (see nginx site configuration file).
# To stop log files from getting huge, the log files are handled by logrotate.
# This rotates/trims the logs daily and saves the logs for 14 days.
# This file should be renamed and moved to "/etc/logrotate.d/licensekeys".
# Test with 'sudo logrotate -d licensekeys'
#
# Things to modify:
# - "/home/my-user/logs/access.log" (set this to the matching path in your nginx config file).
# - "rotate 14" (how many days you want to keep logs for).
# - "manager" is the name of your user account.
#

# The below files are templates for rotating the NGINX logs.  Use as needed.
/home/my-user/logs/access.log {
