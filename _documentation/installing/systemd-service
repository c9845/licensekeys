# This file handles running the licensekeys executable when the server starts.
# This file should be renamed to "licensekeys.service" and should be copied
# to "/etc/systemd/user". After copying, you will need to to run 
# `systemctl enable /etc/systemd/user/licensekeys.service` and then restart the 
# server to make sure the system starts automatically on boot.

# To start the service manually, run `systemctl start licensekeys.service`.
# To stop the service manually, run `systemctl stop licensekeys.service`.
# To check the service's status, run `systemctl status licensekeys.service`.

# Logging will be output to the systemd journal.  You can view the
# logs by typing `journalctl -u licensekeys` (optionally `-f` to "tail").  This
# causes no *.log file to be written elsewhere on the system; systemd
# takes care of all logging and therefore logrotate isn't required.

# Note that the systemd/journalctl logs will store potential sensitive
# information. Make sure that only authorized users can access the logs
# and that logs are cleared or rotated often if not needed.

# Things to modify:
# - ExecStart: path to the license keys executable & configuration file.
# - User: the name of the user running this app.
