# This file is a template you can use to redirect traffic for port 80/443 to the port
# this app serves on internally to the server (by default, port 8005).
# This file should be placed in /etc/nginx/sites-available and symlinked to /etc/nginx/sites-enabled.
# Make sure you handle rotating the error_log and access_log as needed.
# This file was generated in part by https://mozilla.github.io/server-side-tls/ssl-config-generator/.

# Things to modify:
# - "ssl_certificate" (the path to your fullchain.pem file).
# - "ssl_certificate_key" (the path to your privkey.pem file).
# - "ssl_trusted_certificate" (the path to your chain.pem file).
# - "ssl_dhparam" (path to your Diffie-Hellman parameter, see notes in server block below).
# - "server_name" (whatever domain this app is serving on).
# - "proxy_pass" (the IP of the system this app is located on and the port the app is listening on).
# - "error_log" and "access_log" (the directories you want to save log files to).
