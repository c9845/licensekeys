# This file handles automating the renewal of the https certificate.

# This file should copied to "/etc/systemd/user" and renamed something
# like auto-renew-certbot.service.  Note that this file MUST end in 
# ".service" when saved to the system it is to run on.  This file
# must be enabled with `systemctl enable </path/to/file>`.

# This file is run by the `auto-renew-certbot.timer` file.

# ExecStart notes:
# - use "--dry-run" after "renew" for testing.
# - "--no-random-sleep-on-renew" can be placed after "renew" to cause 
#   the renewal to happen exactly at the time specifed in the .timer 
#   file.  There isn't really a con to not use a slightly more random
#   renewal time.  It simply helps the cert authority smooth demand.
# - "--post-hook" reload nginx so that the newest certificate is used.
# - "--quiet" removes a lot of verbose logging.
