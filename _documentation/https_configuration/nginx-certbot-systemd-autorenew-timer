# This file schedules running of the systemd service that renews
# certbot certificates. This timer file runs the similarly named
# filed ending in .service.

# This file should copied to "/etc/systemd/user" and renamed something
# like auto-renew-certbot.timer.  Note that this file MUST end in 
# ".timer" when saved to the system it is to run on.  This file MUST
# also be named the same, minus the extension, to the .service file.  
# This file must be enabled with `systemctl enable </path/to/file>`. 

# You should modify the OnCalender time to be something random.
# The default value "OnCalendar=*-*-* 03,15:14:23" means that renewal
# should run every 3 hours starting at 15:14:23.

# This file runs the `auto-renew-certbot.service` file.
