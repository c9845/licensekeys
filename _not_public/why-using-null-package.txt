Why am I using null package instead of sql.Null... stuff.

"gopkg.in/guregu/null.v3"
null.Int

This error occurs when using a sql.Null... field in a stuct.  This occurs when 
providing data in a stringified JSON blob from JS/HTML via a fetch call that gets
unmarshalled into a golang struct.
{
    TeamID: 0
}

cannot unmarshal number into Go struct field User.TeamID of type sql.NullInt64 Could not parse data to add user.


With the null package, you can unmarshal successfully whether the field is present
in the JS object, if the field is missing, and if the field has a valid value. I 
don't think the sql package was designed to allow use in this manner (unmarshalling
json into a struct).
