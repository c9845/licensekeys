newer ecdh package.
    - investigate use.
    - use crypto ecdh instead of crypto/elliptic?

License Activation?
    - longgggg term thing.
    - api endpoint for checking if a license is valid, active, etc.
    - however, this does mean this license key server has to be on the WAN/public internet which is not a great idea.
        - due to storing private keys in db (even though they might be encrypted).
        - separate, related, server for this that is on WAN but interacts with licensekey serve on LAN (activation server acts as middleman).
        - would need activation tooling in licensekey server anyway in some form.
    - enabled via app setting? enabled per app?
    - sends back activation ID to third-party app.
    - lots of research to do on this.
