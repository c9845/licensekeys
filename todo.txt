newer ecdh package.
    - investigate use.
    - use crypto ecdh instead of crypto/elliptic?

additional verification/expiration functionality.
    - Expired() func - checks if a licensedata is expired. Simple time.Before(time.Now) check.
    - ExpiresIn(d time.Duration) - returns a time.Duration of time until license expires, negative for expired licenses.
    - Explain when expiration checking is separate from Verify() func.
        - Verify() is only for checking signature.
        - Maybe implement new VerifySignature() func that checks signature, and Verify() calls VerifySignature() and Expired()?
            - Could confuse existing users.

License Activation?
    - longgggg term thing.
    - api endpoint for checking if a license is valid, active, etc.
    - however, this does mean this license key server has to be on the WAN/public internet which is not a great idea.
        - due to storing private keys in db (even though they might be encrypted).
        - separate, related, server for this that is on WAN but interacts with licensekey serve on LAN (activation server acts as middleman).
        - would need activation tooling in licensekey server anyway in some form.
    - enabled via app setting? enabled per app?
    - sends back activation ID to third-party app.
    - lots of research to do on this.
