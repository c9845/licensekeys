Handle ROUND in SQL queries.
    - ROUND() function doesn't exist by default in SQLite, and needs compile flag to enable.
        - SQLITE_ENABLE_MATH_FUNCTIONS.
    - For modernc, this functionality is automatically included.

        - https://gitlab.com/cznic/sqlite/-/tags/v1.14.5
    - For mattn, this functionality needs to be enabled by a go build tag.
        - https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3?tab=readme-ov-file#feature--extension-list
    - We currently have queries that use ROUND and others that use golang math library 
      on query results to hanle rounding (see activitylog.go). We should choose one
      method or the other.
        - If using SQLite ROUND, then we need to note build tag for when using mattn library.

License Activation?
    - longgggg term thing.
    - api endpoint for checking if a license is valid, active, etc.
    - however, this does mean this license key server has to be on the WAN/public internet which is not a great idea.
        - due to storing private keys in db (even though they might be encrypted).
        - separate, related, server for this that is on WAN but interacts with licensekey serve on LAN (activation server acts as middleman).
        - would need activation tooling in licensekey server anyway in some form.
    - enabled via app setting? enabled per app?
    - sends back activation ID to third-party app.
    - lots of research to do on this.
