Improved end-user/client verification functionality.
    - Clearer library for reading and verifying license file.
    - Functionality for getting fingerprint, for diagnostics or activation.

Store fingerprint for each license file.
    - Used for activation.
    - Also for diagnostics.

Help doc on how to verify license without our library.
    - Decode license file, file format.
    - How to get fingerprint of license file.
        - Strip signature.
        - What hash algo to use (SHA512)
        - What encoding to use (base 64).
        - What signature algo (ed25519).
    - Display info on license page under advanced info?

Activation.
    - Separate server that just listens for requests with fingerprint.
    - Proxies requests to main server to check fingerprint.
    - Kept separate so it can run on public WAN while license server is on private WAN for security.
    - Separate also means it doesn't need access to SQLite db.
    - Need to send back some sort of "activation id".
    - Track activations per license in db.
    - Activation tooling in library.

UUID for app, license.
    - So license file doesn't have just an integer.
    - Also, future planning for app being multitenant.
    - Private (db ID) versus public (UUID).



Handle ROUND in SQL queries.
    **is this actually an issue??? ROUND() seems work on mattn.
    
    - ROUND() function doesn't exist by default in SQLite, and needs compile flag to enable.
        - SQLITE_ENABLE_MATH_FUNCTIONS.
    - For modernc, this functionality is automatically included.
        - https://gitlab.com/cznic/sqlite/-/commit/17c0726ebc7fe3d5fb8858eb9b75f75c2965b342
        - https://gitlab.com/cznic/sqlite/-/tags/v1.14.5
    - For mattn, this functionality needs to be enabled by a go build tag.
        - https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3?tab=readme-ov-file#feature--extension-list
    - We currently have queries that use ROUND and others that use golang math library 
      on query results to hanle rounding (see activitylog.go). We should choose one
      method or the other.
        - If using SQLite ROUND, then we need to note build tag for when using mattn library.
